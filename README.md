.config files for my linux mint desktop. 

I'll slowly add more and more configurations after some checking.

Currently, there is my wezterm configuration, which is just basically a colorscheme with a little transparent background. Then there's my vim config. Using the [yowish theme](https://github.com/KabbAmine/yowish.vim), fzf and nerdtree. I'll add some keybindings too.
